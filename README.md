# Ball-Platformer-game

Under this project, a 2D Ball platformer was implemented through python. The workflow uses the Pygame library to facilitate the graphic layout and smooth construction of the game. The game developed has 3 levels to play. In game the main target of the player is to reach the exit gate by jumping over the platforms and the obstacles to reach the next level.
